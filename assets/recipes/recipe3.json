Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 00:01:19 - Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 00:01:44 - Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 00:02:31 - Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 00:02:47 - Bake for 30-35 minutes until the cake meets the toothpick test (stick a toothpick in and it comes out clean).\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 00:03:06 - Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.\n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!\n\nNotes\nThe better quality cocoa powder you use the better the cake will taste.\n\n\n00:03:30 - CHOCOLATE CREAM CHEESE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING\n\n\u2705Ingredients\n\n\u2022 1\u00bd cups butter, softened\n\u2022 8 oz cream cheese, softened\n\u2022 1\u00bd cups unsweetened cocoa powder\n\u2022 3 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\u2022 7-8 cups powdered sugar\n\u2022 about \u00bc cup milk (as needed)\n\n\n\u2705Instructions\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 00:03:38 - In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer for best results\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 00:03:57 - Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 00:04:23 - Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as necessary to make a spreadable consistency. The frosting should be very thick and will thicken even more if refrigerated.\n\nNotes\nIn the photos above, an extra dark cocoa powder was used in the frosting. Extra dark cocoa will result in a much darker, almost black frosting.\n\n\nMETRIC MEASUREMENTS\n\u2705Ingredients\n\n\u2022 butter and flour for coating and dusting the cake pan\n\u2022 450 grams all-purpose flour\n\u2022 650 grams granulated sugar\n\u2022 155 grams unsweetened cocoa powder\n\u2022 17 grams baking soda\n\u2022 8 grams baking powder\n\u2022 11 grams salt\n\u2022 4 large eggs\n\u2022 350 ml buttermilk\n\u2022 350 ml warm water\n\u2022 115 ml vegetable oil\n\u2022 10 ml vanilla extract\n\n\n\u2705Instructions\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Preheat oven to 176 degrees Celsius. Butter three 23 centimeter cake rounds.
